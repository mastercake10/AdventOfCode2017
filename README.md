 Advent Of Code 2017 python and rust solutions
 
Day | Python | Solving time | Rust | Solving time
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
1 | [Part 1, Part 2](day1.py) | n/a | - | n/a
2 | [Part 1, Part 2](day2.py) | n/a | - | n/a
3 | [Part 1, Part 2](day3.py) | n/a | - | n/a
4 | [Part 1](day4.py) | n/a | - | n/a
5 | [Part 1, Part 2](day5.py) | 8 sec | [Part 2](rust_solutions/src/day5.rs) | 45 ms
6 | [Part 1, Part 2](day6.py) | 1.6 sec | [Part 1, Part 2](rust_solutions/src/day5.rs) | 60 ms
7 | [Part 1, Part 2](day7.py) | n/a | - | n/a


The elapsed time was measured on a linux system using an Intel Core I7-6700k.

Note:
The table wouldn't be updated every day, also a rust solution is only avelaible for certain parts or days due to bad performance on python.
In addition, the n/a tag indicates a solving time from under 1 second.
